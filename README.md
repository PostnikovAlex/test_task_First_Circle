Test-task

Stack
# React + TypeScript + Vite

Y.A.G.N.I approach is used, so no store or routing is required for this application at this point. 
To run project:
npm run dev 

As the listed in task description API is not working, i made a mock server with mockapi.io that can return minimum 2 entities in one request, so i make 7 requests with 2 entities instead of 15 requests
